# EDX-Thermo-Scientific-Phenom
Program to automatically evaluate EDX data from region measurements
It does not fit of the EDX spectra, but uses just the output of the instruments software. 

The programm automatically searches subfolders for every region-EDX measurement and generates mean values of all measurements.
It shows the spectra of all found measurements, so you can visibly compare and exclude single measurements from data evaluation.
It creates mean graphic, mean spectra, and mean elemental compositions and saves them to files.
